# xfd-radiator

`xfd-radiator` is a simple web-based build radiator. Currently is supports
only the Hudson continuous integration server for its data but the plan is
to support more.

# Usage

*dashboard.html* shows a simple example of the use of the radiator with the
following contents in the body:
 	...
 	<script>
  	var URI = 'http://localhost:8080/hudson/view/All'
  	updatePage();
  	setInterval( "updatePage()", 3000 );
 	</script>
 	...

change the URI to the hudson view that you wish to display and alter the update
interval based upon preference.
